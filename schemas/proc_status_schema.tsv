Column name	Detail level (0 [most pipeline generic] to 2 [most pipeline-specific])	Data type	Description	Specific data format	Examples	Questions
participant_id	0	string	"Participant identifier within a given dataset. Values should be unique. The total number of rows should correspond to the number of recruited participants (i.e., in mr_proc_manifest.csv)."			
proc_complete	0	string	"'SUCCESS': All stages of pipeline finished successfully for the participant (all expected pipeline output files are present). 'FAIL': At least one stage of the pipeline failed for the participant. 'INCOMPLETE': Pipeline has not yet been run for the participant or at least one stage is unfinished/still running."	"One of 'SUCCESS', 'FAIL', 'INCOMPLETE'"		"Maybe a separate 'N/A' status for participants who do not have the relevant imaging data for the pipeline (e.g., someone who has T1w but not DWI data, for a Tractoflow status csv)?"
proc_version	0	string	"Version of pipeline that was run, expected to be the same for all participants."	"Numerical, without prefix 'version' or 'v'"	7.3.0	
proc_datetime	0	string	"Date and time that pipeline run was started, if applicable for a participant."	"'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or None"	2021-05-07 13:48:03	
"'PhaseComplete_' prefixed columns"	1	string	"Arbitrary number of additional columns for different phases/subworkflows of the pipeline, if applicable. Each phase may correspond to an output subdirectory in the participant directory, and is associated with multiple related output files. 'TRUE': All output files of phase are present. 'FALSE': At least one output file of phase is missing."	"One of 'TRUE', 'FALSE'"		
"'StageComplete_' prefixed columns"	2	string	"Arbitrary number of additional columns for specific stages of the pipeline, if applicable. Each stage may correspond to a single output file or a few closely related outputs expected to always be present together. 'TRUE': All output files of stage are present. 'FALSE': At least one output file of stage is missing."	"One of 'TRUE', 'FALSE'"		"Regardless of pipeline-specific stage names, should they be numbered in the order they are run in the pipeline?"
